"""
TODO:

-  : incomplete or to be added
i- : currently being worked on by 'i' (initial)



- Add logging

- Have user enter commands

g- If bot is defaulted to online include it in the loading print screen and actually do the start function for those bots.

- When user enters in the command to start/stop a bot, run that command that does that for that process

- If user asks for info about a bot, clear the terminal and load the information via JSON and display it on screen, type 'back' to go back to the main menu

- ONLY ADD DYNAMIC BOT ADDING IN QT DESIGNER VERSION, THIS IS JUST FOR PRODUCTION PURPOSES

g/ Decided making the configuration for the actual control panel itself to be a txt file. Essentially the user opens the file and there will be things like '*USER_DISPLAY_NAME=your-name-here' so that we don't have to implement a specialized way to handle console commands that configure to control panel itself (plus I feel as if it's more user friendly as it seperates everything into seperate pieces/modules :-] )
